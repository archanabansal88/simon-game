# FreeCodeCamp - Pomodoro-Clock Project
>[Live Demo](https://archanabansal88.github.io/simon-game/)

## Project Requirements:

*  Game is presented with a random series of button presses.

* Each time user input a series of button presses correctly, user see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

* User hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when user personally press a button.

* If user press the wrong button, user will be notified and that series of button presses starts again to remind user of the pattern so he/she can try again.

* User can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

* If user want to restart, user can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

* User can play in strict mode where if he/she get a button press wrong, it notifies him/her that they have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

* User can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. User will be notified of the victory, then the game starts over.
